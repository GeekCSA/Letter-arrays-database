# Letter-arrays-database יחידת החיבור 49

Each folder contains two files

One is a JAVA file with code that generates tables from 13X13 arrays containing only '0' or '1'.
When the form in which the '1' appears, letters are represented in Hebrew.

And the second is a CSV file that represents the arrays after printing (with each array printed in one line)
